Shrek is an astronaut for the FFASA, stationed on a satellite in mid orbit above the earth 
Him and his fellow astronauts work to research and expand space presence for their respective countries 
All of the sudden, the satellited is peppered by high velocity space debris. Shrek and the other astronauts are thrown into disarray 
Shrek takes command and leads the surviving astronauts to the only remaining pressurized module of the satellite 
They sit in dark silence, sipping air to conserve life support, as they await instruction from the FFASA 
The FFASA directs the astronauts on a method to get back to earth. It is risky and suicidal, but their only chance of survival 
Shrek volunteers for the dangerous mission and space walks outside into the destroyed satellite 
He finds the solution that the FFASA directed him towards but he must hurry because he is running out of oxygen. 
Shrek manages to deploy an escape pod and get the rest of the crew inside. The escape pod heats as it dives into earths atmosphere 
Shrek and the crew touchdown in the ocean. Shrek is hailed a hero for his bravery
