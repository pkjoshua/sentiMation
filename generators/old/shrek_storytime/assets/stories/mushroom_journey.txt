Shrek is walking through the forest when he comes across a magical looking mushroom 
Being an ogre, Shrek does not hesitate to try it. 
The taste is dull and shrek grimaces in disgust. He continues on but after a minute something begins to change 
The world around shrek starts to melt into patterns he didn't know were possible 
The trees in the forest begin to laugh at him, the sky begins to stream like a river, and the sun looks down on Shrek suddenly sees a dark force ahead.
Shrek is frightened by the apparitions and begins to run
Mushroom men try to stop shrek but he powers through, sending them flying 
More mushroom men appear with clubs but shrek finds a weapon of his own 
The mushroom men and shrek fight viscously. Then suddenly shrek is taken down with a blow to the back of his head 
Shrek awakes alone in a jail cell. He holds his head trying to remember what happend to him
