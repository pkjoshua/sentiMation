Shrek plays his fiddle sitting on a stump in front of a campfire in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Georgia
He plays a delightful yet delicate tune to fit the cool breeze of the autumn weather 
Suddenly a dark figure appears across from Shrek with a fiddle of its own 
The devil offers Shrek outlandish wealth if he can defeat him in a fiddle match. But the devil will take Shreks soul if he loses 
Shrek stands and accepts the match, knowing well that his skill will be more than enough for this monster
The demon goes first and fire flows on the strings of his fiddle as he plays 
The earth cracks as other demons emerge onto the mountain that they stand on. With all that is going on, Shrek maintains his composure 
The demon finishes and laughs thinking it had already won. Shrek smiles and begins to play his own tune 
A joyous melody emits in visible light from his fiddle as he plays. The demons on the mountain retreat back into the cracked earth they had emerged from 
The devil hangs his head in defeat after Shrek finishes playing his fiddle 
Shrek doesn't want a devils rewards and banishes him back to the underworld
