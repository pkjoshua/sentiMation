([CHARACTER]:1.2), an experienced scientist, studies a (unique bacteria:1.3) found in (luminous onions:1.2) in a high-tech lab. Wearing (protective gear:1.1), he is intrigued by the (bacteria's unusual properties:1.2). The lab is filled with (glowing screens and scientific equipment:1.1), setting a tone of meticulous research (4K, high-resolution:1). (scientist:1.1,lab:1.1)
([CHARACTER]:1.2) intently observes the bacteria as they (divide and multiply:1.3) under his microscope. He notes their (rapid growth:1.2) in his (digital log:1.1), surrounded by (petri dishes and test tubes:1.1). The atmosphere in the lab is one of (scientific discovery and slight apprehension:1.2) as the bacteria exhibit (unexpected behavior:1.3) (4K, high resolution:1). (scientist:1.1,lab:1.1)
In a moment of urgency, ([CHARACTER]:1.2) tries to (contain the bacteria:1.3) using (safety protocols:1.2). He slips on a (wet floor:1.1), creating a (chaotic and dangerous scene:1.3) in the previously orderly lab (4K, high resolution:1). (scientist:1.1,lab:1.1)
Lying on the floor, ([CHARACTER]:1.2) witnesses the bacteria (spreading rapidly:1.3) towards him. They (glow ominously:1.2), creating a (sinister transformation:1.2) in ([CHARACTER]:1.2). The lab is bathed in flickering lights and (long shadows:1.1), highlighting the (escalating biological contamination:1.3) (4K, high resolution:1). (scientist:1.1,lab:1.1)
([CHARACTER]:1.2) slowly opens his eyes, now (infected by the onion bacteria:1.3). His gaze is (haunting and changed:1.2), reflecting the (bacteria's powerful effect:1.3). The lab is dim and eerie, capturing the dramatic shift in ([CHARACTER]:1.2)'s condition and the (unsettling conclusion of the experiment:1.3) (4K, high-resolution:1). (scientist:1.1,lab:1.1)
